# 🌍 **HCMC Population Analysis & Area of Interest Clustering**

## 📌 What is it?
This project consists of two analytical labs focusing on **Ho Chi Minh City's population distribution** and **user interest hotspots**.
- **Lab 1:** Analyzes population statistics, growth trends, and density across districts.
- **Lab 2:** Clusters popular user-clicked locations and visualizes them using heatmaps.

## ❓ Why this project?
Understanding **urban population trends** and **user behavior** can help in:
- **City planning & development**: Optimize infrastructure and public services.
- **Community services**: Improve accessibility and resource allocation.
- **User experience & business strategy**: Identify high-interest zones for businesses and digital services.

## 👥 Who can benefit?
- **Urban Planners & Researchers**: Gain insights into population trends and urban growth.
- **Developers & Data Scientists**: Improve spatial analysis skills using **GeoPandas, clustering techniques, and visualization tools**.
- **Government & Businesses**: Utilize data-driven insights for policy-making and strategic decisions.

## 📊 Demo and Results
### **Lab 1: HCMC Population Statistics**
✅ Identified **highest and lowest population density areas**
✅ Analyzed **growth trends (2009 - 2019)**
✅ Mapped out **ward-level comparisons and density distribution**

### **Lab 2: User Interest Clustering**
✅ Applied **KMeans clustering (k=20)** on high-growth districts
✅ Visualized **user interest hotspots** with **heatmaps**
✅ Mapped high-density clusters across districts

## 🛠️ How did we do it?
### **Lab 1: Population Statistics Analysis**
1. **Set up GeoPandas** to process spatial data.
2. Extracted key insights:
   - Wards with **highest/lowest population**
   - **Largest/smallest area wards**
   - **Population growth analysis (2009-2019)**
3. Mapped data for quick comparisons.

### **Lab 2: User Interest Clustering**
1. Installed essential libraries: `osmnet`, `folium`, `geopandas`.
2. Loaded district boundaries & population data.
3. Identified **top 10 high-growth districts (2017-2019)**.
4. Applied **KMeans clustering** to user-clicked locations.
5. Generated **heatmaps** to highlight popular zones.

## 📚 Key Learnings
- **GeoData Handling**: Worked with **shapefiles, spatial joins, and demographic data**.
- **Clustering Techniques**: Applied **KMeans** for identifying interest hotspots.
- **Data Visualization**: Used **Folium & Matplotlib** to create **interactive maps**.
- **Urban Insights**: Revealed valuable patterns in **population growth & user activity**.

## 🏆 Achievements
🎯 **Detailed Population Insights** – Comprehensive analysis of HCMC’s demographic trends.  
📍 **Effective Heatmap Visualizations** – Highlighting high-density interest zones across districts.  
🚀 **Actionable Urban Data** – Valuable insights for **policymakers, businesses, and developers**.
